# DistortOD
Just a simple variation on the classic OD/Dist soft/hard circuit

The circuit is heavily inspired by the excellent article over at [generalguitargadgets.com](http://www.generalguitargadgets.com/how-to-build-it/technical-help/articles/design-distortion/)
Which in turn is a summary of many classic circuits in the wild.
